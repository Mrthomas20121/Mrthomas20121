# Hi there I'm Mrthomas20121 ðŸ‘‹
I make minecraft mods and javascript tools in my free time.

## inquiries
- want to hire me for a project? shoot me an email at mrthomas20121@gmail.com, I won't do crypto or shady stuff.
- need a minecraft mod? you can request me on a mod on ko-fi page here => https://ko-fi.com/mrthomas20121, I can port mods if you have permission from the original author(or if the mod is open source) but I don't do big mods(e.g thermal expansion, Create) and that applies to port of mods.
