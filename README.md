# Hi there I'm Mrthomas20121 ðŸ‘‹
Currently looking for a job in web dev(view my CV at mrthomas20121.fr/cv/english.html).

## projects
- Minecraft mods(https://github.com/Mrthomas20121-Mods)
- Javascript Tools, they can be found on github(https://github.com/JS-Void-Packages) and NPM(https://www.npmjs.com/~mrthomas20121).

## inquiries
- want to hire me for a project? hit me up on twitter(@Mrthomas20121), discord(Mrthomas20121#9637) or via email(mrthomas20121@gmail.com), i won't do any crypto stuff but open for the rest.
- want me to make you a custom minecraft mod? commission me on ko-fi(https://ko-fi.com/mrthomas20121). i won't make mods for 1.12.2 or below. i won't port mods at all unless you have permission from the original author(and still won't port complex mods like a a big tech mod).
